                        <p>
                            1984 by George Orwell

George Orwell certainly couldn’t have
 known how prophetic his words might have been when he wrote the dystopian novel 1984 in the mid-twentieth century. 
 Great Britain has fallen and given way to Airstrip One, a province of the fictional superstate Oceania. Airstrip One is ruled by a
  perpetual war and Big Brother, a mysterious leader who uses omnipresent government surveillance and a cult of personality to 
  enforce law and order. Winston Smith, the book’s leading character, 
must navigate the Party, Big Brother, 
and his own thoughts, which grow more criminal by the day

                        <h3>BRIEF HISTORY OF TIME BY STEPHAN HAWKINS</h3>
                        <p>
                            BA Brief History of Time by Stephen Hawking

                            Most science books, even well-written ones, read a bit too much like a textbook, but renowned English physicist, 
                            cosmologist, and author Stephen Hawking manages to turn some of the world’s most profound questions—How did the universe begin?
                             What happens in the end?—into captivating reading in A Brief History of Time. A modern physics guide for general readers, 
                             this book manages to make the most mysterious universe elements, 
                            black holes and quarks, regal, ethereal, and entirely accessible.

                        <p>
                            First released in 2001, Dave Eggers’ A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius quickly became a national bestseller and
                             heart-warming classic. Eggers’ book tells the story of a high school senior, on the verge of blossoming toward the rest
                              of his life, when he loses both of his parents in a span of five weeks and soon finds himself the guardian of his eight-year-old
                               brother. Despite that ominous start,
                             the book manages to be wildly funny with an irreverently honest take on learning to live with death
