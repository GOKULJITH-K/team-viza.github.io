   <p>
    Sherlock Holmes she is always the
    woman. I have seldom heard him men-
    tion her under any other name. In his
    eyes she eclipses and predominates the
    whole of her sex. It was not that he felt any emo-
    tion akin to love for Irene Adler. All emotions, and
    that one particularly, were abhorrent to his cold,
    precise but admirably balanced mind. He was, I
    take it, the most perfect reasoning and observing
    machine that the world has seen, but as a lover he
    would have placed himself in a false position. He
    never spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe
    and a sneer. They were admirable things for the ob-
    server—excellent for drawing the veil from men’s
    motives and actions. But for the trained reasoner
    to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and
    finely adjusted temperament was to introduce a dis-
    tracting factor which might throw a doubt upon all
    his mental results. Grit in a sensitive instrument, or
    a crack in one of his own high-power lenses, would
    not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in
    a nature such as his. And yet there was but one
    woman to him, and that woman was the late Irene
    Adler, of dubious and questionable memory.
    I had seen little of Holmes lately. My marriage
    had drifted us away from each other. My own
    complete happiness, and the home-centred inter-
    ests which rise up around the man who first finds
    himself master of his own establishment, were suf-
    ficient to absorb all my attention, while Holmes,
    who loathed every form of society with his whole
    Bohemian soul, remained in our lodgings in Baker
    Street, buried among his old books, and alternating
    from week to week between cocaine and ambition,
    the drowsiness of the drug, and the fierce energy of
    his own keen nature. He was still, as ever, deeply
    attracted by the study of crime, and occupied his
    immense faculties and extraordinary powers of ob-
    servation in following out those clues, and clearing
    up those mysteries which had been abandoned as
    hopeless by the official police. From time to time
    I heard some vague account of his doings: of his
    summons to Odessa in the case of the Trepoff mur-
    der, of his clearing up of the singular tragedy of
    the Atkinson brothers at Trincomalee, and finally
    of the mission which he had accomplished so del-
    icately and successfully for the reigning family of
    Holland. Beyond these signs of his activity, how-
    ever, which I merely shared with all the readers of
    the daily press, I knew little of my former friend
    and companion.
    One night—it was on the twentieth of March,
    1888—I was returning from a journey to a patient
    (for I had now returned to civil practice), when
    my way led me through Baker Street. As I passed
    the well-remembered door, which must always be
    associated in my mind with my wooing, and with
    the dark incidents of the Study in Scarlet, I was
    seized with a keen desire to see Holmes again, and
    to know how he was employing his extraordinary
    powers. His rooms were brilliantly lit, and, even as
    I looked up, I saw his tall, spare figure pass twice in
    a dark silhouette against the blind. He was pacing
    the room swiftly, eagerly, with his head sunk upon
    his chest and his hands clasped behind him. To me,
    who knew his every mood and habit, his attitude
    and manner told their own story. He was at work
    again. He had risen out of his drug-created dreams
    and was hot upon the scent of some new problem.
    I rang the bell and was shown up to the chamber
    which had formerly been in part my own.
    His manner was not effusive. It seldom was;
    but he was glad, I think, to see me. With hardly a
    word spoken, but with a kindly eye, he waved me
    to an armchair, threw across his case of cigars, and
    indicated a spirit case and a gasogene in the corner.
    Then he stood before the fire and looked me over
    in his singular introspective fashion.
    “Wedlock suits you,” he remarked. “I think,
    Watson, that you have put on seven and a half
    pounds since I saw you.”
    “Seven!” I answered.
    “Indeed, I should have thought a little more.
    Just a trifle more, I fancy, Watson. And in prac-
    tice again, I observe. You did not tell me that you
    intended to go into harness.”
    “Then, how do you know?”
    “I see it, I deduce it. How do I know that you
    have been getting yourself very wet lately, and that
    you have a most clumsy and careless servant girl?”
    “My dear Holmes,” said I, “this is too much.
    You would certainly have been burned, had you
    lived a few centuries ago. It is true that I had a
    country walk on Thursday and came home in a
    dreadful mess, but as I have changed my clothes
    I can’t imagine how you deduce it. As to Mary
    Jane, she is incorrigible, and my wife has given her
    notice, but there, again, I fail to see how you work
    it out.”
    He chuckled to himself and rubbed his long,
    nervous hands together.
